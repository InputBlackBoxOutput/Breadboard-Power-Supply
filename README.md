# Breadboard Power Supply

A convenient power supply to provide power while building and testing analog/digital circuits on a breadboard


## Features
* Snaps right onto a breadboard
* Input power can be derived from a 12V SMPS via barrel jack or 5V via USB cable
* Switches to switch the output voltages on/off 
* Provides variable voltage 

## Technical specs
* *Output voltages:* Fixed: 5 ± 0.150V and 3.3 ± 0.099V and Variable: 1.25V to ≈Vsupply 
* *Output currents:* 1.1A max for each voltage when connected to a 12V 2A SMPS and 500 mA total when connected to USB

### Caution: Do not connect current hungry components when input power is provided via USB
